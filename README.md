# Portfolio - Nathaniel Perry

_Collection of my portfolio projects with notes and demo videos._

## Summary:

- Explore my projects in the **Projects** directory, where each project has its own markdown file with notes and a demo video link.
- All my portfolio demo videos are available in this Google Drive folder: **[Portfolio Demos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qrpljgr2T5PQL8Llyx-HrsRQaWo9behY?usp=drive_link)**.

### Springboard Disclaimer:

Some projects were built as part of Springboard’s Software Engineering Career Track. Project solutions for their assignments are not public, but feel free to reach out if you'd like to see the code! My personal projects, however, are publicly available, so check them out in my **[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/natep1123?tab=repositories)** or via title-links in the project’s markdown file.
