_Click the 'Fire!' button to unleash random damage on your enemyâ€”and brace for the counterattack! This simple React app pits player against enemy in a turn-based battle until one reaches 0 health!_

## Practice with React.js:

- State Management
- Component Design
- Prop Drilling
- Event Handling

## Component Design

- Main --> renders App comp
- App --> manages gameState ("active", "gameOver"); renders title (h1) and GameField comp
- GameField --> renders either Active comp or GameOver comp (exclusive) and Message comp --> initializes states for playerHealth, enemyHealth and message
- Active --> active gameplay; dynamically change health values upon click of fire button, message at bottom
- GameOver --> when a health value reaches 0, renders restart button and changes message
- Player --> renders "Player" and health value
- Enemy --> renders "Enemy" and health value
- Message --> renders message bottom of GameField comp
